# Bulk Artifacts and Large File Guard Runbook

## Overview
Repository policy prevents committing blobs > 5 MB (5,242,880 bytes) directly to Git. The CI guard (`lu_machinery/ci/check_large_files.py`) enforces this in pull request and merge queue workflows.

## Remediating Guard Failures
When `check_large_files.py` fails with an unallowlisted oversized blob:
1. **Move to artifact store (Recommended)**: Use `lu_machinery/storage/artifacts.py` to manifest and manage bulk data out of Git:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m lu_machinery.storage.artifacts manifest build --group <group> --pre HEAD
   ```
   Note: `lu_machinery.storage.artifacts manifest build` covers only groups defined in the `data/` split (`registry/artifacts/classification-v1.tsv`). It is not a general storage mechanism for files under other trees such as `site/` or `curriculum/`.
2. **Add an allowlist entry**: If the blob is canonical source that must stay tracked, add an entry to `scripts/ci/large_files_allowlist.txt` with exact path, size in bytes, and reason.

## Allowlist Format
`scripts/ci/large_files_allowlist.txt` uses a tab-separated text format:
`<repository-relative-path>\t<size-in-bytes>\t<reason>`
- Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are comments/ignored.
- Exact repository-relative path match (no wildcards or prefixes).
- Recorded sizes represent provenance; modifications to allowlisted paths remain exempt.
- Seed or refresh from `origin/main` from the product checkout's root, where `lu_machinery` is installed in `.venv`: `.venv/bin/python -m lu_machinery.ci.check_large_files --repo-root "$PWD" --seed-allowlist`. Seeding reads the product's `registry/artifacts/classification-v1.tsv`, so it runs against a product checkout, never this repository. The tool reads the selected product checkout: name it with `--repo-root` (default: selected product checkout) or with `LU_PRODUCT_ROOT`; without either it fails closed. Seeding updates `ci/large_files_allowlist.txt` in the selected checkout's Python tree (`scripts/ci/large_files_allowlist.txt` in a product checkout). `lu-machinery` 0.1.4 writes `lu_machinery/ci/large_files_allowlist.txt` in the product checkout instead; with it, also pass `--allowlist scripts/ci/large_files_allowlist.txt`. Re-running `--seed-allowlist` overwrites any hand-written reasons with generator-derived reasons.
